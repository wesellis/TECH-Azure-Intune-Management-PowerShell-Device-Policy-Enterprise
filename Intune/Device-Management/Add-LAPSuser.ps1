.SYNOPSIS
Creates a local user account with a randomly generated password and adds it to the local Administrators group to be targeted by LAPS.

.DESCRIPTION
This script was made for use with Intune but can be adapted. This script creates a new local user account with a 10-character random password. The account is added to the local Administrators group. The password is set to never expire for convenience, making this script useful in scenarios like implementing Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) configurations.
Deploy this script from Intune as a Platform script. Run as system.

.PARAMETERS
None.

.PREREQUISITES
- The script must be run with administrative privileges.
- Modify the `$Username` variable to set the desired account name before running the script.

.NOTES
- The script sets a random password using alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9).
- By default, the execution policy is bypassed for the session to ensure the script runs without restrictions.
- Script checks if account already exists and exits without changes if it does.
- Designed for automated deployment through Intune with no user interaction.
- Ensure the account creation complies with your organization's policies for local administrator accounts.
