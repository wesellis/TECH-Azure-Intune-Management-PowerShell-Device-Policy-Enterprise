.Synopsis
   Install-DellDriverFiles cmdlet used to download and install the driver pack for the individual system.
   This script can be used by an administrative user to download and install all the drivers for a particular system.
   IMPORTANT: Make sure you are using latest PowerShell version 5 or newer to execute this cmdlet. Execute " Get-Host" to check the version.
   IMPORTANT: Make sure to run this script in 64-bit PowerShell Host only. As PNPUtil command to install drivers is supported only on 64-bit. 
              While deploying the script via Intune, make sure to select " Yes" - " Run Script in 64-bit PowerShell Host" .    
.DESCRIPTION
   Cmdlet used to download and install driver pack for the individual system. 
   - DownloadDir, REQUIRED, the download path where all the driver files will be downloaded and installed from.
   - Restart, OPTIONAL, pass in -Restart switch if local system restart needs to be performed after driver installation (recommended)
   - ProxyServer, OPTIONAL, the custom proxy server address.
   - ProxyPort, OPTIONAL, the custom proxy server port.
   - ProxyUser, OPTIONAL, the custom proxy Username.
   - ProxyPassword, OPTIONAL, the custom Proxy Password
     The ProxyPassword is a SecureString parameter, user must convert to SecureString before passing the ProxyPassword parameter to 
     Install-DellDriverFiles cmdlet.
     e.g. $WEProxyPass = " Password"
          $WESecureProxyPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString $WEProxyPass -AsPlainText -Force
     NOTE:
     1. This Script will create a Log File - " DellDriverInstaller_Log.txt" under the DownloadDir to track the driver installation data.
